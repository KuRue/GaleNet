# Project Status

This document provides a quick snapshot of GaleNet's progress and what's next.

## Current Progress
- Core package structure with testing and packaging helpers.
- Loaders for HURDAT2 and IBTrACS hurricane tracks.
- ERA5 patch extraction and preprocessing utilities.
- Baseline evaluation script and metrics.
- Installation, data pipeline, architecture, training, and API documentation.
- Tutorial notebooks demonstrating basic workflows.
- Preliminary GraphCast integration hooks.

## Remaining Milestones
- Finalize GraphCast integration into the data pipeline.
- Extend training loop for GraphCast/Pangu-based models.
- Publish comprehensive evaluation guide and usage examples.
- **Upcoming**
   - Expand end-to-end data pipeline documentation and schema coverage *(target: 2025-10)*

## Phase Goals
1. **Phase 1 – Data Foundation**: finalize dataset loaders, integrate GraphCast baseline, and document evaluation workflows.
2. **Phase 2 – Model Development**: integrate advanced forecast models and train baseline predictors.
3. **Phase 3 – Evaluation & Deployment**: benchmark models, refine APIs, and prepare for public release.
