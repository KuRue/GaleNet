# Project Status

This document provides a quick snapshot of GaleNet's progress and what's next.

## Current Progress
- Core package structure with testing and packaging helpers.
- Loaders for HURDAT2 and IBTrACS hurricane tracks.
- ERA5 patch extraction and preprocessing utilities.
- Baseline training and evaluation scripts with metrics.
- Installation, data pipeline, architecture, training, and API documentation.
