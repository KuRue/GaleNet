# Project Status

This document provides a quick snapshot of GaleNet's progress and what's next.

## Current Progress
- Core package structure and data pipeline scaffolding in place.
- Initial data loaders for HURDAT2 and IBTrACS hurricane track datasets.
- Early preprocessing utilities and validation helpers implemented.
- Repository tooling for testing, linting, and packaging configured.

## Remaining Milestones
- Expand preprocessing and feature engineering for additional datasets (e.g., ERA5).
- Implement training loop for GraphCast/Pangu-based models.
- Establish evaluation framework and benchmarking suite.
- Build comprehensive documentation and usage examples.

## Phase Goals
1. **Data Foundation** – finalize loaders, preprocessing, and validation for all required sources.
2. **Model Development** – integrate forecast models and train baseline hurricane predictors.
3. **Evaluation & Deployment** – benchmark models, refine APIs, and prepare for public release.
